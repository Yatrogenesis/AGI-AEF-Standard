## üî¨ Scoring Methodology

### **Weighted Composite Score Calculation**

```
AGI-AEF Score = Œ£(Dimension_Score √ó Weight) √ó 255/100

Where:
- Dimension_Score = Individual dimension assessment (0-100)
- Weight = Dimension weight percentage
- Final score normalized to 0-255 scale
```

### **Dimension Scoring Formula**

```
Dimension_Score = (Œ£ Audit_Points / Maximum_Possible_Points) √ó 100

Where:
- Audit_Points = Points earned in specific criteria
- Maximum_Possible_Points = Theoretical maximum for dimension
```
